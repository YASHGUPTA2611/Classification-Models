# Classification-Models

All of my classification projects are in this repository

1. Brest Cancer ML :-

This model helps us to predict that the cancer is benign or malignant.

' breast_cancer.csv' is ther dataset file.

' Breast cancer ml ' is the jupyter notebook, I first recommend to install sweetviz library because i have used it. It gives a better analysis of our dataset.


2. Credit Card fraud :-

This is a classification model which helps us to predict that a transaction is fraudulent or genuine.

Install sweetviz library for the visualization. 

You can find the dataset on Kaggle :  https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud


3. Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster :-

In this classification model we will predict that a person on Titanic has survived or not.

' TITANIC ML ' is the jupyter file for the model.
