# Classification-Models

All of my classification projects are in this repository

1. Brest Cancer ML :-

This model helps us to predict that the cancer is benign or malignant.

' breast_cancer.csv' is ther dataset file.

' Breast cancer ml ' is the jupyter notebook, I first recommend to install sweetviz library for better and good prediction. 


2. Credit Card fraud :-

This is a classification model which helps us to predict that a transaction is fraudulent or genuine.

I have attached a html file('credit_card_feature_analysis.html'), which give us all the visualization for our dataset.

You can find the dataset on Kaggle :  https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
